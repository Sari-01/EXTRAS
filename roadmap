Resources
Documentation: Node.js official documentation
Books: "Node.js Design Patterns" by Mario Casciaro, "Node.js 8 the Right Way" by Jim Wilson
Courses: Online platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or freeCodeCamp
Communities: Join Node.js communities on Reddit, Stack Overflow, or specialized forums
Practice
Projects: Build a variety of projects to apply what you've learned (e.g., a blog platform, e-commerce site, real-time chat app)
Contributions: Contribute to open-source Node.js projects on GitHub
By following this roadmap, you'll build a solid foundation in Node.js and gain experience with both the core concepts and advanced features of the platform.
